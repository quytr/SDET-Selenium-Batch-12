How to handle Calendars:
    1. Click on the calendar.
    2. Locate the month and get the text.
    3. If the desired text is not visible --> we will keep clicking on next and keep updating the text of the month.
    4. As soon as we found our desired month --> grab all the cells from the table.
    5. Loop through the cells.
    6. One the cell value is matched with our condition --> click on the matched date.

Why do we need screenshots in testing?
    In testing, it is very important to take screenshots in order to prove that our test case covered certain functionality.

In Selenium, in order to take screenshots, we will be using TakesScreenshot interface.
 TakesScreenshot ts = (TakesScreenshot) driver;
        // the screenshot is taken on this step
        File srcFile = ts.getScreenshotAs(OutputType.FILE);

        try {
            FileUtils.copyFile(srcFile, new File("screenshots/SmartBear/adminLogin111.png"));
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }


Actions class:
    is given by selenium to capture keyboard and mouse events such as:
        - move to element
        - drag and drop
        - double click
        - right click
