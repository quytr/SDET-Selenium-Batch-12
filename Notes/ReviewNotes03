Alerts:
    1. Web Based Alerts -- html -- can be dealt using selenium.
    2. JavaScript Alerts --
    3. Windows Based Alerts --

Frames:
    You need to switch to the frame in order to deal with the desired element
    For switching, you use driver.switchTo.frame();
        1. By the index number of the frame
        2. By the name or id
        3. By accessing the frame as a WebElement

<html>
    <body>

    </body>

</html>

click on the checkbox that resides inside another frame...

Explicit wait:
    WebDriverWait wait = new WebDriverWait(driver,20);
    wait.until(ExpectedConditions.visibilityOfElementLocated());
Why the timeout is important?
    The maximum time to wait, if the element does not appear the throw the exceptions.
    If not, then the time wait will be infinity.



implicit wait waits to locate element, explicit wait for the action


use implicit wait when the element is not even in the dom. needs to appear and use explicit wait if the element has
certain condition associated with it like visibility, click-ability, etc,
