Alert:
    Alert is a pop up message. Alert takes a complete focus of our main page that we are working on.
    We cannot proceed until it is handled.

3 types of alerts:
    1. Web based alert/ html alerts - we can simply inspect and perform need actions.
    2. JavaScript alerts/ browser alerts - we can handle these alerts by using switchTo method we cannot inspect.
    3. Windows based alerts - we cannot handle with Selenium

Types of JS alerts:
    1. Simple alert - click ok
    2. Confirmation alert - either cancel or click ok
    3. Prompt alert - enter the text and then click ok or cancel.

To handle JS alerts, we only have 4 methods:
    1. accept() - click ok
    2. dismiss() - click cancel
    3. getText()
    4. sendKeys()

getText() on WebElement and getText() on Alert() are different because they are from different interface and the
functionalities are different. One is looking out for WebElement. And one is look out for the alert pop up. There is
no method overriding, they are not extended each other. They are just the same name.

Authentication Alert:
    1. To handle authentication alert, we need to pass username and password on url.
    2. username:password@ in front of the link starts, right after https://
    ex: "https://admin:admin@the-internet.herokuapp.com/basic_auth"
    3. username:password@ Method ONLY works for authentication alert

Frames:
    Frame is the separate independent window in our webpage.
    Frames allow developers to represent multiple views on one page.

3 ways to interact with Frames:
    1. by index
    2. by name or ID
    3. by WebElement

in alerts - switch to alert and switch automatically back.
in frames - switch to a frame manually and switch manually back to the main page.
     driver.switchTo().frame(0);  //switch to frame
     driver.switchTo().defaultContent();  //switch to the main page
to search for iframe: //iframe in the search box
