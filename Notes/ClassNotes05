Radio Buttons:
    - Cannot unselect.
    - Can only select one option.
    - Circle box.

CheckBoxes:
    - Can select and unselect.
    - Can select multiple options.
    - Square box.

Handling Checkboxes and Radio Buttons:
    If you have only 1 checkbox or radiobutton - you can just click on it.
    If you have multiple choices - store them in List (it will return Array List) and loop through.

DropDowns:
    Dropdown is a menu which gives us an opportunity to select one or more options.

Types of dropdowns:
    1. Single select
    2. Multiple select

Handling dropdowns: (handling = interact with dropdowns)
    1. Click on dropdown and click on the option.
    2. Using Select Class: in order to use Select Class, we need to make sure our dropdown has select tag.

Selecting an option from a dropdown can be done in 3 ways:
    1. By index: select.selectByIndex(index_number)  //indexing starts from 0
    2. By visible text: select.selectByVisibleText(String_value)
    3. By value:  select.selectByValue(attribute_value)

Select Class is import from Selenium library.
Select select = new Select();

Whenever you interact with multiple elements, you store them inside the container such as List, Set...

To deselect in ONLY multiple DD:
    1. deselectAll()
    2. deselectByIndex(index_number)
    3. deselectByVisibleText()
    4. deselectByValue()
