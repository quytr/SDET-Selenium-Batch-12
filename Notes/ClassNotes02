What is WebElement?
    Anything we see on the web page is considered to be a WebElement
    ex: buttons, images, text boxes, check boxes, link

HTML - HyperText Markup Language

DOM - Document Object Model.
    It is the browser's internal view of the webpage.
    Also called as Developer's tools or Dev tools (go to the website, right click -> Inspect)
    Document -> can be stored any document such as pdf, excel...
    Object -> any lines in HTML is considered as Object
    Model -> it is just a layout of the HTML

Locator
    is an address or a position of an WebElement on the web page
    is used to locate or identify WebElements on the web page

8 Locators:
    1. ID (brown) always look for ID, ID is unique
    2. Name (brown)
    3. TagName: (purple)
    4. Xpath
    5. LinkText
    6. Partial Linktext
    7. CSS Selector
    8. Classname

HTML Scripting Meaning:
puprle -- tags || button, input, div
brown -- attribute || name, class, id
blue -- attribute value

Why do we need many locators?
    Developers may not provide all the locators for all the elements
    Some locators may have duplicate values in different nodes
    some locators may not be applicable for the elements we are looking for
    e.g. linkText and partialLinkText are only used for the links

"a" tag is also called an anchor tag

if 2 or more elements have the same attributes and attribute values, selenium will only interact with the first element
it locates.


<a href > a link
when the click() doesn't work because it doesn't wait for the page loading, we need to add Thread.sleep(2000)
