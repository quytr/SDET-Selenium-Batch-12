Handling multiple windows (tabs):
    In order to handle multiple windows we will be using:
        1. getWindowHandle()  --> getting String value in return
        2. getWindowHandles() --> getting a SET of unique ID that holds the address of the window

WindowHandle:
    is a unique ID that holds the address of the window or a tab.
    It is approximately a 40 alphanumeric character ID.

Synchronization:
    is the process of bringing the speed of 2 or more components the same level. In this case, we are bringing out
    script and page load to the same speed level.

Thread.sleep()  --  static wait/ unconditional wait

Types of selenium waits:
    1. Implicit wait
    2. Explicit wait
    3. Fluent wait

Implicit wait -- Global Wait (Entire script)
    - It tells the WebDriver to wait for a certain amount of time before throwing an exception.
    - It will only be written once and will be applied to the whole session of the execution.
    - We can say that Implicit wait is a global wait.
    - Implicit wait works with findElement() method.
    - Implicit wait is usually set to 20 seconds. If your element is found in any time between the given time, the
    remaining time will be ignored and your script will move on to the next line or action.
    - If the element is not found in a given time, ONLY then you will get an exception.
