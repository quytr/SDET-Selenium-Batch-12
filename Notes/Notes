Review Class 1:
Why are we using selenium?
    using selenium to save times, money, and resources.
    if we find any bugs, then we can report to developers.

library -- to import and have access for all methods.
driver -- to access the websites
WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver(); --creating an instant of chrome driver

1. driver.get()
2. driver.navigate().to()
    driver.navigate().to("http://gmail.com");
        we can go back and forward, refresh
        wait for the page to fully load
3. driver.quit() -- quit all the browser
4. driver.close()  -- close the current tab
5. driver.maximize()

HTML: is a language, that has particular structure, by using this particular structure, front end developers can build
a website.
attribute:
    to decide the attributes/property/quality/format.
    to identify particular attribute uniquely.

<div>:
    to divide that page to sections.

DOM:

Locators:
    to locate web elements (whatever you see on the web page is web element)

Why do we need to access those elements?
    to perform actions
How?
    using different locators in selenium to locate them.
How many locators are there? 8
    1. ID
    2. Name
    3. Xpath
    4. CSS Selector
    5. Link Text
    6. Partial Link Text
    7. Tag name
    8. Classname

Relative:
//input[@id='userName']

Starts-with:
we can use start with
in the xpath
//tagname[start-with(@attribute,"starting of the attribute value")]
//input[start-with(@id,"user")]
Example:
<input id="imageno.1"/>
//input[start-with(@id,"imageno")]

contains:
//tagname[contains(@id,'some portion of value')];

Example:
<input id="imageno.1"/>
//input[contains(@id,"mageno")]


by text:

//tagName[text()="abcd"]



css selector:

tagname[attribute= "attribute value"]

shotcuts:
id = #

<input @id="rotwiller"/>
input#rotwiller

class = .

<input @id="rotwiller" @class="bigdogs"/>
input.bigdogs















hey dom
bring us the tag "input"       --> //input
who has an attribute id       ---> [@id]
and its value is  userName     --->[@id='userName']
