Tables (many pages) divided into several pages, the navigation bar is called PAGINATION.


Every time we move to the next page and the next page is reloaded. we have to relocate the element.

Interview Error:
Error: StaleElementReferenceException - the worst error
    there some wrong with your element, it works before but somehow it doesn't work.

// interview question of the day --> stale element reference exception.
*anything causes reload/refresh the whole page (ex: click to nextpage);
*webdriver is not able to retrieve the elements of the page we already located because page is reloaded/refreshed (not table itselfs, whole page)
*the elements we located are changed. selenium forgets about them. because the referenced web element is no longer attached to the DOM.
*if we want to avoid from that exception on refresh/reload situation, we need to get/locate every element after each refresh/reload again.
*we can use loop so that we can get webelements every time we are going through the loop.
