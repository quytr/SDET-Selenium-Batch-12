     or

     pageFactory
        in pageFactory, we can use @FindBy annotation to find elements instead of driver.findElement()
        Page Factory is a class provided by Selenium WebDriver to support Page Object Design patterns.
        In Page Factory, testers use @FindBy annotation. The initElements method is used to initialize web elements.
        Similarly, one can use @FindBy with different location strategies to find web elements and perform actions
        on them.
