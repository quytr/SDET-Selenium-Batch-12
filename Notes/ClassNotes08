Types of selenium waits:
    1. Implicit wait
    2. Explicit wait
    3. Fluent wait

Implicit wait:
    will be applied for findElement method.
    only works to find/locate element then it will move on, it doesnt wait until it's visible for any condition.
    put it right after get(url)
     driver.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(20, TimeUnit.SECONDS);

Explicit wait or WebDriver Wait:
    - is used to tell the WebDriver to wait for a certain condition before throwing an exception for a specified
    condition.
    - Explicit wait works with ExpectedConditions class and waits until certain conditions are met or the given time is
    achieved.
WebDriverWait wait = new WebDriverWait(driver, 20);
wait.until(ExpectedConditions.visibilityOfElementLocated(By.xpath("//p[contains(text(), 'First Name')]")));

* sign in xpath is a wild card which can identify any tagname
//*[contains(text(), 'Welcome')]

Fluent Wait or Global Wait (Entire script):
    - It is used to tell the WebDriver to wait for certain condition as well as its frequency before throwing an exception.

Implicit wait -- waits to locate the element
Explicit wait -- waits until certain condition
Fluent wait -- sets timeouts, polling and ignores needed exceptions in the given time period

WebTables:
    - WebTables are elements on the webpage, which are constructed by having rows and columns

Types of WebTables:
    1. Static WebTable (rows and column are fixed)
    2. Dynamic WebTable (rows and column can be changed)

WebTables consist of different sections or parts
<table>
    <thead>  -- heading
            <tr>  -- rows
                <th></th>  -- column data or heading data
            </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>  -- table body
            <tr>
                <td></td>  -- actual table data
